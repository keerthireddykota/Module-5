**Summary:**

In this analysis, the performance of various drug regimens, including Pymaceuticals' drug Capomulin, was evaluated based on a study of 249 mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors. The goal was to compare tumor development across different treatment regimens over a 45-day period. 

Key tasks included:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Merging datasets and removing duplicate mouse timepoints.
2. **Summary Statistics:** Generating statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation for tumor volumes by drug regimen.
3. **Visualizations:** Creating bar charts and pie charts to show the distribution of drug regimens and gender of mice, as well as a box plot to assess tumor volume distributions and identify outliers.
4. **Line and Scatter Plots:** Analyzing tumor growth over time for a single mouse on Capomulin and examining the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume for the entire Capomulin group.
5. **Correlation and Regression:** Calculating the correlation and performing linear regression analysis to determine the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.

The results from these analyses will help assess the effectiveness of Capomulin compared to other treatment options in controlling tumor growth.
